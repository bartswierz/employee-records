## Project Overview

Provide an overview of your project. Explain what it does, why it is useful, and any other relevant information.
MERN stack project built with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS, SCSS, and Material UI showing CRUD functionality for employees at the current company. My MERN stack application features a captivating space theme that adds an immersive and visually stunning experience for users. The highlight of this theme is an animated star background that gracefully traverses across the screen, creating a sense of movement and depth reminiscent of a space voyage. This project can be used as a useful tool to learn the MERN stack as the logic is easy to follow and can be used as a foundation for your own MERN stack applications.

## Features

<!-- List the key features of your project. Describe each feature briefly and explain how it benefits the users. -->
This project focuses on using CRUD operations 
- Employee Listing: Display a list of all employees with relevant details, such as name, position, level, and salary.
- Employee Update: Edit and update existing employee records with new information. Modify details such as name, designation, department, contact information, and other relevant fields.
- Employee Deletion: Remove employees from MongoDB, permanently deleting their records.
- Data Validation: Validate user input to ensure the integrity and consistency of employee records. Perform checks on required fields, data types, and any custom validation rules.
- Responsive Design: Develop a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, allowing users to access and manage employee records from desktop and mobile devices. Large viewport devices display a table, whereas small viewport devices display individual row data as a card component.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing employee records.
- Express.js: Web application framework for building the server-side RESTful API.
- React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface components.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- Material UI: Material-UI is a popular React UI library that provides pre-built components following the Material Design guidelines. With its rich set of components and seamless integration with React, Material-UI is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces in MERN stack applications.
